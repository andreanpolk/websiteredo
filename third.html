<div class="titles"><i>Current Exhibition:</i>    <strong>The Eighth Sense</strong></div>
<div class="paras">A cleverly coded couture piece, fashioned from materials
    responsive to real-time digital media, which change its colour remotely, bringing the digital to the physical.
<br><br>
    The Unseen aims to discover and investigate the human state by using a physical garment that reads
    human magnetism, translated through the sculpture by the use of colour and pattern.
<br><br>
    For instance red portrays anger, nerves and anxiety, whereas green reflects teaching,
    sociality and people. Blue reveals calming, truthfulness and peace while white mirrors
    an inner state of sensitivity, intuitiveness and psychic ability.
